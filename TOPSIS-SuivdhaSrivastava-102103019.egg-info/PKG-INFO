# TOPSIS


Submitted By:Suvidha Srivastava

***

## What is TOPSIS?

The Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) emerged
in the 1980s as a method for making decisions involving multiple criteria. TOPSIS
selects an alternative based on its proximity to the ideal solution, measured by the 
shortest Euclidean distance, and its distance from the negative-ideal solution, 
measured by the greatest distance.

## How to install this package:
```
>> pip install Topsis-Suvidha-102103019
```


### In Command Prompt
```
>> topsis data.csv "1,1,2,1" "+,+,-,+" result.csv
```

## Input file (data.csv)

The decision matrix should be constructed with each row representing a Model alternative, and each column representing a criterion like Accuracy, R<sup>2</sup>, Root Mean Squared Error, Correlation, and many more.

Model | Correlation | R<sup>2</sup> | RMSE | Accuracy
------------ | ------------- | ------------ | ------------- | ------------
M1 |	0.79 | 0.62	| 1.25 | 60.89
M2 |  0.66 | 0.44	| 2.89 | 63.07
M3 |	0.56 | 0.31	| 1.57 | 62.87
M4 |	0.82 | 0.67	| 2.68 | 70.19
M5 |	0.75 | 0.56	| 1.3	 | 80.39

Weights (`weights`) is not already normalised will be normalised later in the code.

Information of benefit positive(+) or negative(-) impact criteria should be provided in `impacts`.

## Output file (result.csv)


Model | Correlation | R<sup>2</sup> | RMSE | Accuracy | Topsis_score | Rank
------------ | ------------- | ------------ | ------------- | ------------ | ------------- | ------------- 
M1 |	0.79 | 0.62	| 1.25 | 60.89 | 0.849592 | 2
M2 |  0.66 | 0.44	| 2.89 | 63.07 | 0.143187 | 5
M3 |	0.56 | 0.31	| 1.57 | 62.87 | 0.597633 | 3
M4 |	0.82 | 0.67	| 2.68 | 70.19 | 0.364575 | 4
M5 |	0.75 | 0.56	| 1.3	 | 80.39 | 0.877204 | 1

The output file contains columns of input file along with two additional columns having **Topsis_score** and **Rank**
